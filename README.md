Blender Duplicator Rig Project: reverse engineering using Blender of "Duplicator Rig" by Meindbender Studio. Only educational purposes. 

Features already working: 

Eyes: sticking in and out of main body, with independent eyesocket controllers (all done with warp modifiers), eyelids open/shut (via armature deformation and action constraints), eye global deformation via lattices. Tracking of pupils. Motion of complete pair.

Mouth: Moves up/down via shapekeys. Secondary deformation of mouth shape via armature. Controllers travels with deformation via auxiliary mesh (dorito effect). Complete shut and solidify turn off.

Body: initial deformation using mesh deformers and armature combined.
